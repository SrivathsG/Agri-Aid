Make sure guidelines are detailed and enough for any farmer to follow along without any doubts. Make sure the guidelines you provide are for the Indian climate and in accordance with Indian practice. Do not give me any sort of background. Directly start-off by how to grow. let every step be detailed and in every step also highlight what problems a farmer may come across and provide the steps for that as well. Use simple english.\")"

       "> **How to Grow Papaya Cost-Effectively in the Indian Climate**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Step 1: Land Preparation**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * Select well-drained loam soil with a pH range of 5.5 to 7.0.\n",
       "> * Prepare the soil by deep plowing and harrowing.\n",
       "> * Ensure proper drainage to prevent waterlogging.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Step 2: Planting**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Season:** Sow seeds in spring or summer (February-March or July-August).\n",
       "> * **Spacing:** Plant seeds 1.5-2 meters apart in rows that are 2.5-3 meters wide.\n",
       "> * **Planting Depth:** Sow seeds 1 cm deep in the soil.\n",
       "> * **Seed Rate:** 200-300 grams per acre.\n",
       "> * **Seed Treatment:** Treat seeds with a fungicide to prevent damping-off disease.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Step 3: Water Management**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Irrigation:** Water papaya plants deeply at regular intervals.\n",
       "> * **Frequency:** Irrigate every 3-4 days during dry weather.\n",
       "> * **Amount:** Apply 50-100 liters of water per plant per week.\n",
       "> * **Problem:** Overwatering can lead to root rot.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Step 4: Fertilization**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Fertilizer Requirement:** Papaya plants require a balanced supply of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and micronutrients.\n",
       "> * **Application:** Apply a balanced fertilizer with an NPK ratio of 10:10:10 at the rate of 200-300 grams per plant per year.\n",
       "> * **Frequency:** Fertilize plants every 3-4 months.\n",
       "> * **Problem:** Overfertilization can lead to nutrient burn or fruit cracking.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Step 5: Pest and Disease Management**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Major Pests:** Mealybugs, whiteflies, aphids, fruit flies.\n",
       "> * **Control:** Use organic or chemical insecticides as needed, following manufacturer's instructions.\n",
       "> * **Major Diseases:** Fusarium wilt, powdery mildew, anthracnose.\n",
       "> * **Control:** Use disease-resistant varieties, practice crop rotation, and apply fungicides as needed.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Step 6: Pollination and Fruiting**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Pollination:** Papaya plants are dioecious, meaning they have separate male and female trees. Both need to be present for fruit production.\n",
       "> * **Fruiting:** Fruits develop after pollination and reach maturity in 6-8 months.\n",
       "> * **Problem:** Poor pollination can lead to low fruit set.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Step 7: Harvesting**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Harvest Time:** Harvest papaya fruits when they are fully ripe and have a yellow-orange skin color.\n",
       "> * **Yield:** Well-managed papaya plants can yield 100-200 fruits per plant per year.\n",
       "> * **Problem:** Premature harvesting can result in poor quality fruit.\n",
       "> \n",
       "> **Additional Tips for Cost-Effectiveness**\n",
       "> \n",
       "> * **Intercropping:** Grow other crops like vegetables or legumes in between papaya plants to maximize land utilization.\n",
       "> * **Vertical Trellising:** Trellis papaya plants to support their growth and improve fruit quality.\n",
       "> * **Mulching:** Apply mulch around papaya plants to conserve moisture, suppress weeds, and regulate soil temperature.\n",
       "> * **Pruning:** Remove suckers and excess foliage to encourage fruit production and improve plant health.\n",
       "> * **Pest and Disease Monitoring:** Regularly monitor your papaya plants for signs of pests or diseases and take prompt control measures if necessary."
